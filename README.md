# An example that uses GitHub Actions for php projects
This is simple project for testing GitHub Actions which includes:
- phpstan
- php-code-sniffer
- phpunit
- codecov

### [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org)
PHPStan is a static analysis tool for finding errors in your code without actually running it. It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write tests for the code. It moves PHP closer to compiled languages in the sense that the correctness of each line of the code can be checked before you run the actual line.

### [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
PHP_CodeSniffer tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.

### [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de)
PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

### [Codecov](https://codecov.io)
Codecov provides highly integrated tools to group, merge, archive and compare coverage reports. Upload reports from multiple languages and coverage tools with ease.
